# HideNGoBoomGame

What is this:
This is not the actual project itself, but the build to a game I designed and programmed in Unity. 

Overview of game:
This game is a simple online multiplayer game that can be played with as little as one player. 
The point of the game is to try and survive for as long as possible by avoiding contact with various minions that will chase you around the arena. 

Controls:
Keyboard: WASD
OR:
Point/touch and move.

***The controls are configurable in the main menu***
